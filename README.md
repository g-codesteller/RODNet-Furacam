# FuRaCAM: Fused Radar and Camera Object Detection Network

## Overview
Our work is extension of RODNET 2021 in following ways:
* We add camera contextual features to the RADAR to improve detection accuracy 
* We also create our own dataset and extend ROD2021 dataset with data from Indian Context.


## Official Repository [Original Authors]
This implementation is based on [RODNET 2021](!https://github.com/yizhou-wang/RODNet) i.e. the official implementation of our RODNet papers 
at [WACV 2021](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Wang_RODNet_Radar_Object_Detection_Using_Cross-Modal_Supervision_WACV_2021_paper.html) 
and [IEEE J-STSP 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9353210).
